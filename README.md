## <a name="overview"></a>Overview

The standards set out in this repo are to keep all developers within the Xaxis Tech Services team aligned and accountable to each other, in order to produce the highest quality of code.

This being said, rules are made to be broken... Well occasionally, therefore even though we endeavour to write "perfect code" it is not always attainable, so feel free to "break" the rules in extreme circumstances were the standards do not take a definitive stance, **BUT** seek the senior software engineers guidance, as they will try to help you keep to the standards as best as possible.

### What we expect
We expect the following from all developers:
* Understand and follow the standards outlined in this document
* Understand the methodology
* Write code with the knowledge that someone else may need to maintain it in the future.
* Select tools that ultimatley benefit the project.
* ``<!--Comment-->``, ``/*Comment*/`` and ``// Comment`` - This ultimatley saves us all time in the future.
* Peer code reviews should be standard. 
* Have fun, coding isnt a chore :-)

### Coding Goals

* Semantic
* Accessible
* Predictable
* Reusable
* Flexible
* Resilient
* Understandable
* Scalable
* Maintainable
* Interoperable
