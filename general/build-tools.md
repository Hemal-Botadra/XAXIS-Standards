# Build Tools

We use a range of tools to help us create amazing applications. They are:

* Gulp
* Node.js
* NPM
* Webpack
* Jasmine &amp; Karma
* Jenkins
* PHPSpec

## Gulp

We use gulp for frontend tasks. Things like compiling our SCSS, compressing all images and minifying our Javascript. JSLint is also available however if writing Typescript your IDE should already be linting your scripts.

For more information on gulp and all there packages visit the below site.

## Node and NPM 

Node is an open source server framework, which can run on various platforms. It uses Javascript on the server. We primarily use Node for NPM (Node package manager). NPM is a package manager which runs on node.js you will need this to install dependencies etc for all projects.

As Bower is being deprecated we have to ensure we no longer use it and use NPM instead.
